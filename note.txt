Life is a journey, not a destination.
The best way to predict your future is to create it.
Don't wait for opportunity, create it.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
Dream big and dare to fail.
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
Act as if what you do makes a difference. It does.
Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.
If you don't stand for something, you will fall for anything.
Success is not how high you have climbed, but how you make a positive difference to the world.
The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.
Be the change you want to see in the world.
Don't let yesterday take up too much of today.
Change your thoughts and you change your world.
Tough times don't last, tough people do.
You can't go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending.
Happiness is not something ready-made. It comes from your own actions.
Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.
The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
Your time is limited, don't waste it living someone else's life.
Believe in yourself, take on your challenges, dig deep within yourself to conquer fears. Never let anyone bring you down. You got this.
The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be.
If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to people or things.
Success is not measured by what you accomplish, but by the opposition you have encountered, and the courage with which you have maintained the struggle against overwhelming odds.
Good things come to those who wait, but better things come to those who go out and get them.
Strive for progress, not perfection.
If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door.
You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.
In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on.
The best revenge is massive success.
A year from now you may wish you had started today.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
You were born to win, but to be a winner, you must plan to win, prepare to win, and expect to win.
Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.
Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.
Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
Never give up on a dream just because of the time it will take to accomplish it. The time will pass anyway.
The only way to have a good day is to start it with a positive attitude.
It's hard to beat a person who never gives up.
Set your goals high, and don't stop till you get there.
Opportunities don't happen. You create them.
The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that little extra.
Failure is only the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently.
If you want to achieve greatness, stop asking for permission.
You don't need to see the whole staircase, just take the first step.
Success is not how far you got, but the distance you travel
